# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

![App Usage Image](/Develop/images/PRG%20Screenshot.jpg)

## Description

When creating an open-source project on GitHub, a high-quality README is essential. This command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input, freeing the project creator to focus on the project itself.
